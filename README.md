# Efficient Wasserstein barycenter in MATLAB

This repository includes the propotype codes for computing the Wasserstein barycenter.
The codes are released to reproduce parts of the experiments reported in the following journal paper:

- Jianbo Ye, Panruo Wu, James Z. Wang and Jia Li, "Fast Discrete Distribution Clustering Using Wasserstein Barycenter with Sparse Support", *IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing* ([arXiv:1510.00012](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00012) [stat.CO], September 2015), accepted with mandatory minor revisions.

If you need more efficient and scalable implementation in MPI and C (patent pending), please contact the author.

The codes also implements algorithms in the following papers:

- Jean-David Benamou, Guillaume Carlier, Marco Cuturi, Luca Nenna, and Gabriel Peyr√©, "Iterative Bregman projections for regularized transportation problems." *SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing* 37.2 (2015): A1111-A1138.
