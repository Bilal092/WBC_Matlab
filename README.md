# Efficient Wasserstein barycenter in MATLAB

This repository includes the propotype codes for computing the Wasserstein barycenter.
The codes are released to reproduce parts of the experiments reported in the following journal paper:

- Jianbo Ye, Panruo Wu, James Z. Wang and Jia Li, "Fast Discrete Distribution Clustering Using Wasserstein Barycenter with Sparse Support", *IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing* ([arXiv:1510.00012](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00012) [stat.CO], September 2015), accepted with mandatory minor revisions.

The codes also implements algorithms in the following papers:
